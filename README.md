# SIPUDA (Sistem Perpustakaan Daring) LMS
RMPPL project exam about Very Simple Library Management System using PHP.

### Note:
I just learn programming and not intended to be use for a real case. I know it's sucks btw and most of the codes are from the internet but I've been really hard to study about language programming.

> ATTENTION:
IT'S STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND CANNOT TO BE USE FOR A MOMENT. IT EVEN CANNOT CREATING DB YET!.


###### Step To Connect The Database
Since I'm not creating the tool for the set up yet, you have to manually input the information on hard-code.
1. Go to config/db_data.php
2. Edit database credential there
3. Please note that you have to manually create db, table and input records on phpMyAdmin. I'll provide it later so you don't have to create from scratch again.

###### Credits
Credits will be available here since it's the very first time I do this. I do beg your apologize.

Thank you.

### Update
New SQL template has been uploaded. You can import that to phpMyAdmin to running the script.
