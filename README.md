# SIPUDA (Sistem Perpustakaan Daring) LMS
RMPPL project exam about Very Simple Library Management System using PHP. This project are for my team school project assignment.

### Note:
I just learn programming and not intended to be use for a real case. I know it's sucks btw and most of the codes are from the internet but I've been really hard to study about programming language.

> ATTENTION:
IT'S STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND CANNOT TO BE USE FOR A MOMENT. IT EVEN CANNOT CREATING DB YET!.

### Step To Connect The Database
Since I'm not creating the tool for the set up yet, you have to manually input the information on hard-code.
1. Go to config/dbdata.php
2. Edit database credential there
3. Now, you can import sql file to phpMyAdmin. But create table first before importing.

### The File That Not Yet Finish!
- register.php
- registerscript.php
- register-engine.php
- breadcrumb.php
- cek-ketersediaan.php (NOT YET CREATED)
- account/forgotpw.php (NOT YET CREATED)
- and half on ADMIN ACCOUNT folder

###### Credits
Credits will be available here since it's the very first time I do this. I do beg your apologize.

Thank you.

### Update
New SQL template has been uploaded. You can import that to phpMyAdmin to running the script. The template is on config/sql_template.
